# thesis_code
My bachelors thesis (computer science and econometreics) code for computation. 

Im measuring how does the inclusiuon of polynomials and interactions between independent variables used in the Å»mijewski's bankruptcy prediction model (Zmijewski, M.E. (1984) "Methodological Issues Related to the Estimation of Financial Distress Prediction Models") affect the performance of a logistic regression model. The data used in the analysis is from the paper (Zieba, M., Tomczak, S. K., & Tomczak, J. M. (2016). "Ensemble Boosted Trees with Synthetic Features Generation in Application to Bankruptcy Prediction") and is publicly availible at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data.
